    <h3>Renewable energy is are resources that are naturally replenished such as sunlight, wind,the movement of water and geothermal energy</h3>

    <h3>Solar energy</h3>
    <h4>Solar energy is emiited from the sun, solar energy is generated by solar panels</h4>

    <h3>Wind</h3>
    <h4>by using wind turbines, we can generate energy through wind</h4>

    <h3>Water</h3>
    <h4>the movement of water can be used as a source of renewable energy, hydro dams are built to generate energy</h4>

    <h3>Geothermal energy</h3>
    <h4>steam geysers produces extreme heat that can be exploited as renewable energy</h4>
